# NichTest

It is a software platform based on C/S framework, combining ATS, calculator and mine clearance.

## ATS ##

After i joined in Innolight RD department, we began to develop this ATS at the end of 2015. There are three software engineers: One codes web and database. One is responsible for equipmemnt driver. My major is the left: UI, design mode, test model and algorithm etc.

In the early of 2016, it was on line in RD lab. Its capacity is more than 1K each month. It always uses for QSFP, CFP and SFP products function test. 

Here are two part: one is **web** and one is **app** in PC. User can input parameters and create/maintain test plan for product on the web. These parameters/infomation will be stored in database. (We use SQL as our database tool)

The app is the software client. When it is to test product, it will get parameters from database firstly. And then run test model step by step.

algorithm: Least squares. Please see the [link](https://github.com/tclxspy/Articles/blob/master/algorithm/MD/%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%2303--%E8%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3%E6%9C%80%E5%B0%8F%E4%BA%8C%E4%B9%98%E6%B3%95%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E5%92%8C%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81.md) for detailed introduction.

## Calculator ##

A new guy coded this project under my guidance. She just was graduated from NWPU (Northwestern Polytechnical University). This is her firt project, while she did not learn any OOP langague. I am her mentor.

## Mine clearance ##

This project also was coded by a new guy. He studied Csharp langague when he was in college. It is so easy to coding.
