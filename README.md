# NichTest
it is a software platform, combining ATS, calculator and mine clearance.

## ATS ##

It uses for QSFP, CFP and SFP products function test in lab. Here are two part: one is web and one is app in PC. User can input parameters and create/maintain test plan for product on the web. these parameters/infomation will be stored in database. We use SQL as our database tool.

The app is the software client. When it is to test product, it will get parameters from database firstly. And then do test model.

Totally, there are three engineer to develop this software platform. One codes web and database. One is responsible for equipmemnt driver. My major is the left: UI, design mode, test model and algorithm etc.

design mode: **abstract factory**

This project also was coded by a new guy. He studied Csharp langague when he was in college. It is so easy to coding.
